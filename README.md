# Shakespeare Productions API

An OMDB-style REST API for upcoming and recent Shakespeare theatre productions worldwide: play titles, companies, venues, cities, countries, run dates, status, and optional metadata. Built for theatre apps, research, media, and operational tooling.

> Commercial deployment asset. Not an open contribution project.

Legacy Note: Earlier iterations referenced a "Game Awards" domain. All award endpoints and parameters have been fully removed as of v3.0.0; the repository now focuses solely on Shakespeare production data.
## üöÄ Deployment & Operations

Production reference stack: Netlify (Functions + static) + Neon (Postgres) + Stripe (subscriptions). Detailed deployment, Neon, Stripe, and quick start guides now live under `docs/technical/`.

Fast path:
```bash
Netlify UI basics:
  Build command: npm run build
  Functions dir: netlify/functions
  Publish dir: public
  Add required env vars (`DATABASE_URL`, Stripe keys, etc.)
```

Migration from Supabase? See the "Migration & Legacy Notes" section inside `DEPLOYMENT.md` (Supabase env removal + Neon connection format) ‚Äì prior separate docs were consolidated.

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev  # nodemon auto-restart (Express)

# Or test Netlify functions + static site locally
netlify dev
```

Legacy (pre‚Äë2.0) dataset context referenced board game award sets (Spiel des Jahres, Origins Awards, etc.). Those artifacts have been purged (v3.0.0) and are no longer shipped.

## ‚ö° Quick Start (Local)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Express + auto-reload
# or test serverless functions directly
node local-functions-server.js &
node scripts/run-function.js api "s=wingspan&apikey=demo"
```

Stripe test bootstrap (optional now, required before subscriptions):
```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill DATABASE_URL + Stripe keys
node setup-stripe-products.js
# add printed price + webhook secrets to Netlify env and redeploy
```

Health & build metadata:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/.netlify/functions/health
```

### Examples
Get production by ID:
```
GET /api/?i=prod_1
```
Search for productions:
GET /api/?s=Hamlet&year=2025
GET /api/?bgg_id=361
Get productions by year:
```
GET /api/years/2025
List productions:
```
GET /api/productions
```
Each production object contains:
```json
{
  "Response": "True",
  "id": "prod_1",

  "status": "upcoming",
  "ticket_url": "https://tickets.example/hamlet-rsc",
  "official_url": "https://rsc.org/hamlet",
  "synopsis": "A prince struggles with revenge and mortality.",
  "start_year": 2025
}
```

## üéØ Use Cases
### For Theatre Companies
- Promote upcoming productions programmatically
- Syndicate run schedules to partner sites
- Monitor competitive programming in key cities
### For Developers
- Build city or venue production discovery apps
- Automate newsletters of upcoming Shakespeare shows
- Power ticket alert bots
### For Researchers
- Analyze geographic distribution of Shakespeare productions
- Study seasonality of programming
- Cross-reference cultural funding & staging frequency
### For Media
- Rapid fact-checking of current runs
- Auto-generate production context sidebars
- Trend pieces on staging popularity
- **Neon PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Users, API keys, usage, future production indexing
- **In-memory dataset (current search)** ‚Äì Pending SQL-backed search flag (`USE_DB=1`)
<!-- Award-era research bullets removed -->
Current search layer reads from `lib/productions-data.js`, which can load a private full dataset at `internal/enhanced-productions.json` (gitignored). The repo includes a minimal `data/sample-productions.json` for development & demonstrations.
<!-- Removed legacy award comparison bullet -->
1. Place the JSON file at `internal/enhanced-productions.json`
### For Media
- Inspired by the excellent OMDB API structure
- Built for theatre data products

**üé≠ Shakespeare Productions API** ‚Äì Bringing live Shakespeare production data to developers worldwide.

- **Netlify Functions + Express fallback** ‚Äì Serverless first, local dev convenience
- **Neon PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Users, API keys, usage, (future) richer production indexing
- **In-memory dataset (current search)** ‚Äì Pending SQL-backed search flag (`USE_DB=1`)
- **Rate limiting & usage tracking** ‚Äì PL/pgSQL (`validate_api_key_enhanced`) sets remaining quota headers
- **Build metadata** ‚Äì `build-info.json` surfaced via `/health`

## üîê Security & Rate Limiting

- Tiered daily/monthly quotas (Free / Professional / Enterprise)
- API key validation + suspension logic (Stripe payment_failed events)
- CORS (`*` default ‚Äì tighten if embedding in browsers)
- Helmet security headers via Express fallback
- Planned: peppered key hashing (`API_KEY_SECRET`), narrower CORS

## üìà Key Environment Variables (excerpt)

See full matrix in `docs/technical/DEPLOYMENT.md` (populate for buyer handoff).
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...?...sslmode=require

REQUIRE_API_KEY=true
DEPLOY_ENV=production
```
Optional overrides: `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` (Express path), `USE_DB=1` (future search switch).
